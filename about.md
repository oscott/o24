**Annual?**
This hypertext sits in a long line of previous annuals and other editions of the past. started around the turn of the millennium, I have been making a new info-site each year or whenever to point people at the current stuff I find interesting or have been doing. As a general rule, I do not link to past documents, but I'm feeling different now I am forty and will hopefully dot some links around this doc.

**Rights to Copy?**
My current stance is, as usual, by visiting my work you enter into a strict user agreement. As soon as you sense my work, you have a duty, as a reasonable person, to understand that you are processing symbols of my reality that have been provided through exerting effort on my part and yours. Therefore, I believe we must discuss anything that comes out of this relationship before it develops any further or spirals out of control. It is our duty to one-another and any other entity passing by. Please let me know if we have entered into a collaboration of any sort with me through my works. I believe I am an approachable person and incredibly open-minded in regard to collaborations. I am here to discuss this further.
